  <h2>This Is How To Comment In HTML, CSS, And JavaScript</h2>
  <p>It took us one month to make our way back to the US dear fans but we eventually found our way.</p>

<p>The break was definitely necessary.</p>

<p>I was getting older by the day working my expensive hair off my head. By that point, I was producing less content than ideas.</p>

<p>To reduce my stress, we took a little vacation to Eastern Europe and settled for a strange mix of tours in Greece.</p>

<p>These were local tours &mdash; everything said and done was in Greek. Can&rsquo;t say I was fully aware of this when reserving the darn things.</p>

<p>There were lots of half-assed translations on my end to DM (who insists he speaks Greek because he was born there but understands absolutely nada).</p>

<p>Long story short, it was a struggle.</p>

<p>Worse yet was trying to sneak a pic of DM without sunglasses, a frown, or being plain weird.</p>

<p>And he dares wonder why he doesn&rsquo;t have a decent picture for his LinkedIn profile.</p>

<p>Anyways, between the ships, buses, planes, and donkeys we had a nice break to recharge.</p>

<p>&#8230;Sort of, I was partly working remotely.</p>

<p>I figured might as well have a little update post so you know we&rsquo;re still kicking and can&rsquo;t wait to hop back onto our coding game!</p>

  <h2>New THT site redesign is now live</h2>
  <p>Another blog site redesign?</p>

<p>Yes siree, you bet it is.</p>

<p>We redesigned The Helpful Tipper blog for the third time because I like change.</p>

<p>Change is good and change is necessary when you work in the perpetually changing landscape of tech.</p>

<p>Being ready to embrace new ideas, a new look, and quite a few new bugs is what design and development are all about.</p>
<h3>Blog site redesign objectives </h3>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t head into this redesign cycle without a plan &#55358;&#56595;</p>

<p>No, we came prepared which is something you should always do so you don&rsquo;t lose sight of your goals.</p>

<p>Redesigning a website isn&rsquo;t an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; thing.</p>

<p>There are so many different aspects and elements to consider so a plan is downright a necessity to avoid overwhelm and intimidation.</p>

<p>This round of redesign was inspired by three objectives:</p>
<h4>1) Solidify THT&rsquo;s theme and brand </h4>
<p>I admit that the only thing we knew for sure about THT was its name and purpose (i.e. learning how to code).</p>

<p>Other than those two aspects, we had no concept in mind, no logo or theme, or color palette &#55357;&#56393;&#55357;&#56392;</p>

<p>Ever since we launched The Helpful Tipper those details were slowly filled in based on preferences and inspiration.</p>

<p>During this redesign, I broke DM&rsquo;s heart (just a little) by retiring our astronaut mascot.</p>

<p>We are not &ldquo;exploring the digital universe&rdquo; any longer because we are learning how to move through it first.</p>

<p>As the goal of THT solidified into a blog where we share our coding journey and knowledge, we realized our claims required simplification.</p>

<p>So here we are, one astronaut short but 100% certain of our mission, your needs, and the brand that is THT.</p>
<h4>2) Create opportunities for more line drawings </h4>
<p>There&rsquo;s one element I didn&rsquo;t retire and that&rsquo;s the line drawings.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m the main artist behind them so please be kind in your comments.</p>

<p>I consider them with a pride that is bound to make DM&rsquo;s eyes roll right out of their sockets if he keeps on rolling them so.</p>

<p>Whatever thoughts we might have on the matter of line drawings, they&rsquo;re a unique aspect of THT.</p>

<p>They add a personal touch and make our relationship more intimate, no?</p>

<p>After all, I take considerable time making them so we can give you a better glimpse at our lives &#55357;&#56898;</p>

<p>Coding might be technical but what newbies in the world of tech don&rsquo;t realize until fully immersed is that we spend lots of time cooperating.</p>

<p>Building digital products, writing code, debugging, testing, and designing are all collaborative activities that require teamwork!</p>

<p>You and THT aren&rsquo;t just a person reading from a screen - we&rsquo;re here to support each other so we can be the best versions of ourselves one tag at a time &#55357;&#56841;</p>

  <p>Playful young man and woman lineart. We collaborate in the most interesting of ways. </p>
  <h4>3) Build an email subscription list</h4>
  <p>Building a list out of your readers is something any of my bloggers out there just &ldquo;get&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s nice if y&rsquo;all follow us on our socials (please do, we&rsquo;re spunky!) but if one of those platforms goes kaput one day, we absolutely don&rsquo;t want to sink with the ship &#55357;&#57075;</p>

<p>When you give us the pleasure of sending you our blog updates and spontaneously fabulous communications (now and then, I promise we don&rsquo;t spam), we&rsquo;ll never lose you.</p>

<p>And we don&rsquo;t want to lose you because we&rsquo;ve such a long, happy journey ahead of us.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s the long-winded explanation of why we took extra care to choose an email provider that won&rsquo;t drive me crazy.</p>
<h4>We ditched Mailchimp and found a new email provider </h4>
<p>We started off with Mailchimp because it&rsquo;s so popular in the blogging world.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid my developer brain never got around to their dashboard UI. I couldn&rsquo;t make heads or tails of their system even though it looks all pretty and sensible.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Mailchimp wasn&rsquo;t intuitive in the least and that made me dread doing anything related to email lists.</p>

<p>It took a single Google search to realize there were plenty of other email providers we could try, one of which is Mailerlite, our current provider.</p>

<p>I confess to having had a...</p>
